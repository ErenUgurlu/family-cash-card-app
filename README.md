This repository was created during the "Building a REST API with Spring Boot" course I took to learn the Test-Driven Deployment methodology. 
This course adopts a test-first approach, Test-Driven Deployment, to ensure my application works correctly.
It involves writing and passing tests at each step while developing the application's functionality. 
The "Red, Green, Refactor" process (Red — think about what you want to develop. Green — think about how you will pass your tests. Refactor — think about how you will improve your existing implementation) is used to enhance code quality.
